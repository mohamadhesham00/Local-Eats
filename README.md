# Local Eats - September 2023

## Overview

Welcome to the README for Local Eats, a cutting-edge food ordering system currently under development as of September 2023. This project adopts the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, leveraging technologies such as .NET Framework, C#, and ASP.NET. The back-end is powered by Entity Framework and PostgreSQL, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation.

## Project Focus

### Current Development Focus

- **Food Ordering System:** Local Eats aims to provide an efficient and seamless food ordering experience for users.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The project follows DDD principles to enhance the organization and clarity of the codebase.

### Technologies Used

#### Front-end

- **HTML5 and CSS3:** Standard technologies for structuring and styling the user interface.

#### Back-end

- **.NET Framework:** A robust framework for building Windows applications and web applications.
  
- **C#:** A versatile programming language developed by Microsoft.

- **ASP.NET:** A web application framework for building modern, dynamic, and data-driven applications.

- **Entity Framework:** An object-relational mapping framework for efficient data access.

- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system for data storage.

### Key Concepts and Learnings

This project has been a valuable learning experience, exposing me to a range of key concepts and best practices in software development:

- **RESTful API:** Implementation of RESTful principles for designing web services, ensuring interoperability and simplicity.

- **Microservices Architecture:** The project adopts a microservices architecture, promoting modularity and scalability.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Leveraging events for communication between microservices, enhancing decoupling and flexibility.

- **Message Queues:** The use of message queues facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices.

- **JWT for Authentication:** Implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.

- **Service Independence:** Microservices are designed to be independent, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

- **Clean and Reusable Code:** The project focuses on writing clean, modular, and reusable code for maintainability.

- **Design Patterns (Builder-Mediator):** Adoption of design patterns like the builder and mediator patterns for efficient and scalable code organization.
